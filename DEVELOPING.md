# Developing

## Generating docs

    npm run docs

This depends on gitbook.

The doc build also requires that [ebook-convert](https://calibre-ebook.com) from Calibre is installed and on the path.

## Testing
    npm test

## npm run build
If you run into this error: Error: EMFILE, open 'sdk/node_modules/react/package.json' run the solution from here: https://github.com/andreypopp/react-app-express/issues/1#issuecomment-34113065

## Code Style

All components (js/components) should have the top level class `sdk-component`, as well as a class matching their name (in all lowercase, dash-delimited).

## Releasing
Update the version number in package.json, commit, push, and tag the release on github. Run:

    npm run release

then go into release subdirectory and run

    npm publish

## Linking to a github directory of the sdk in an app
Go to the directory of your sdk git checkout and type:

    npm run release
    cd release
    npm link

Go to the node_modules/react directory of the root directory and type:

    cd ../node_modules/react
    npm link

Go to the node_modules/openlayers directory of the root directory and type:

    cd ../openlayers
    npm link

In your sdk app type:

    npm link boundless-sdk
    npm link react
    npm link openlayers

In your sdk git checkout run:

    npm start

to keep updating the release js files with babel --watch when the source files change.
